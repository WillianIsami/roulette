# Roulette Game Overview

Welcome to the Roulette Game project. This comprehensive project combines both frontend and backend technologies to create a dynamic betting game experience. The project is divided into two main sections: the Vue.js frontend and the Django backend (server), each serving its unique role in delivering a seamless gaming platform.

## Overview

The Roulette Game project is designed to simulate a real-world betting scenario, focusing on a roulette game. Users can register, log in, place bets, and watch the outcome of their bets in real-time. The project leverages modern web technologies to provide a rich, interactive user experience.
